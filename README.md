# list-majority-detector
Algorithms for detecting when one value makes up more than half of a list

This was a coding challenge that was on an a shared-coding website that an interviewer sent to me a couple days before
the interview.  I worked on the problem for a few hours across two nights, and while it turned out that the interviewer
had a different problem that he pasted in when the interview started, I offered to share what I had come up with on
this problem.

Given an array, detect if there is a majority value, a value that shows up as more than half of the values of the array.
If there is no majority value, return -1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
